# Simple Web Calculator

Hey there, this is the most simplest calculator you could see in my repo, there's no framework at all, only just a native good old HTML, CSS, and JS.

This project was meant only for my IT assignment and as an educational lesson for my friends also for others.

This **Simple Web Calculator** serves only 2 inputs, and 4 math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) with a single result.

The main idea behind this project is to understanding about the `Setter` and `Getter` in a program and acts as **OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming).

Hope this helps!
